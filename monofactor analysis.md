   In the results of the correlation analysis of clinical outcomes, we compared each characteristic of the patient at admission (a) and discharge (b) through Figure 1-5 and found that only 
 the correlation of hs-CRP characteristics changed, while the correlation between admission and discharge of LDH, Neu#, Urea, and PLT characteristics remained unchanged. In Figure 6, we 
 get the same result through the consistency test.

   In the correlation analysis results of disease severity, we compared each characteristic of the patient at admission (a) and discharge (b) through Figure 1-6 and found that except for 
ALB and LDH features, Sex, DM, MONO%, and LYMPH% features had the same correlation with admission and discharge. In Figure 7, we get the same result through the consistency test.

   In the correlation analysis results of spike antibody, we compared each characteristic of the patient at admission (a) and discharge (b) through Figure 1-9 and found that only the correlation of LYMPH features changed, while the correlation between admission and discharge of Age, RDW_CV, PLT, LDH, eGFR(CKD-EPI), RDW_SD, PCT, and TCHO features remained unchanged. In Figure 10, we get the same result through the consistency test.

   Conclusionï¼š According to the results of the correlation analysis we have done, for most serological features, the correlation between features and outcomes did not change after admission and discharge. The treatment received had no significant effect on serological conditions and associated coronavirus markers." It is feasible to combine the two timings in one dataset.
