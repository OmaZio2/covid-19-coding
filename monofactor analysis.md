   In the results of the correlation analysis of clinical outcomes, we compared each characteristic of the patient at admission (a) and discharge (b) through Figure 1-5 and found that only 
 the correlation of hs-CRP characteristics changed, while the correlation between admission and discharge of LDH, Neu#, Urea, and PLT characteristics remained unchanged. In Figure 6, we 
 get the same result through the consistency test.


**disease severity prediction**

   In the correlation analysis results of disease severity, we compared each characteristic of the patient at admission (a) and discharge (b) through Figure 1-6 and found that except for 
ALB and LDH features, Sex, DM, MONO%, and LYMPH% features had the same correlation with admission and discharge. In Figure 7, we get the same result through the consistency test.
